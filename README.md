This repository contains four NCL script: AFI.ncl computes Annual Freezing Index from daily temperature data; ATI.ncl computes Annual Thawing Index; Kappa_Ft.ncl optimizes freezing thresholds using three observational datasets through Kappa coefficient validation; and Permafrost_distribution_data.ncl generates final permafrost distribution maps.
